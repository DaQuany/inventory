# Overview

I created a simple inventory system that enables me to add and delete items through using map and other funcitons in C++.

The software helps us to see the menu, purchase items, sell it back to the market. We can also check the current money the player has.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work


- I want to be able to add more flexibility with the item options to purchase and sell.
